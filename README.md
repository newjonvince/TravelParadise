This project was developed as part of a certification course and demonstrates the integration of a frontend web application with a JSON-based API.

The application dynamically retrieves country information from external data sources (such as Wikipedia-derived datasets) and presents it in an HTML-based user interface. The focus of the project is on API consumption, data transformation, and frontend integration.
